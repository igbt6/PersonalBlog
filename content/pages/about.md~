###Hello!

I'm Lukasz Uszko, an embedded software engineer from southern Poland. I work at [Delphi](http://www.delphi.com), a company specializing in automotive solutions. I work there as an embedded software developer, creating software that runs in your car. My interests are widely spread from high level programming in languages like JAVA or Python through coding low level drivers in C/C+. In my leasure time I mainly run, sleep or play football.
